		 Tuesday, December 17, 2002 				 Unfazed amp; proud to be a Kashmiri
 															- parliament strike convict brazen after court verdict  OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 16: Being a Kashmiri and being a Muslim, Im proud of it, Shaukat Hussain alias Guru said as he was whisked away from the court room this afternoon, minutes after S.N. Dhingra, the special judge for cases related to the Prevention of Terrorism Act, convicted him and three other accused in the December 13 Parliament attack case.																								Dressed in a mud-colour pathan suit and a blue cap, Shaukat seemed hardly perturbed by the court verdict. There was no sign of tension on his face.																								But his wife, Navjot Sandhu alias Afsan Guru, who is also an accused has been mentally upset for some time now, according to a lawyer fighting her case. As Afsan Guru, escorted by lady constables, arrived in the court room around 2 pm, she started asking the policemen: What have I been brought here for?																								Afsan Guru was allowed to sit with her child on her lap in the courtroom packed with lawyers and reporters, while the other accused  Shaukat, Mohammad Afzal and suspended Delhi University lecturer S.A.R. Geelani  were standing in the dock.																								I have to ask one question. You did not tell me (when I asked you) in the police station as well, the completely shattered convict muttered in Hindi after Dhingra read his order and left the chair. What did you all do to my brother and sister-in-law? she asked before being taken away by lady constables.																								The constables said they would tell her later. Her brother and sister-in-law are staying in Australia.																								While Afsan Guru was unable to fathom what was happening, Mohammad Afzal seemed his usual self, with his quite and intense looks not revealing his emotions. 																								I had asked for three lawyers. They did not provide me, he said when asked for his comments on the verdict.																								Geelani has been working in Delhi for 17 years. How come he has suddenly become a terrorist? was all Afzal could ask while being taken back to judicial custody after being convicted.																								With his face partly covered with a thick black flowing beard and a black-and-white scarf and glasses, Afzal appeared a look-a-like of Masood Azhar, the Jaish-e-Mohammad chief who was discharged by a Pakistani court on Saturday.
