		 Friday, January 10, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Parliament attack victim falls to death				 																																																	 new delhi (PTI): ANI cameraman Vikram Bisht, who was injured in the terrorist attack on Parliament in 2001, died here on Thursday morning after a fall from his wheelchair.				 																																																	He is survived by his wife and two children.				 																																																	Bisht was brought to the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences, where he died at 8.30 am, ANI sources said, quoting doctors. The doctors feared that Bishts fall could have blocked blood circulation to a part of his brain, the sources added.				 																																																	Bisht, who was critically injured in the attack on December 13, 2001, was admitted to AIIMS and discharged on November 6, 2002.				 																																																	He had received bullets in his spine during the attack. On the first anniversary of the attack, Bisht even visited the Parliament complex on his wheelchair.				 																																																	The mortal remains of the 28-year-old cameraman were consigned to flames at the Nigambodh Ghat in the presence of mediapersons. Information and broadcasting minister Sushma Swaraj, who was unable to attend the funeral, sent a wreath. 				 																SC vetoes Rajasthan sati relief				 																																																	 New Delhi: The continuing practice of sati, banned by law, has prompted the Supreme Court to order the trial of some accused in a Rajasthan sati case, reports our legal correspondent.				 																																																	A division bench of Justices R.C. Lahoti and Brijesh Kumar set aside a Rajasthan High Court order and ordered the accused to face trial that should get over within six months.				 																																																	According to the apex court, the glorification of sati includes observance of any ceremony, taking out procession (to glorify), creation of trust, collection of funds, construction of a temple to perpetuate honour (of the widow) or those who participated. So any one guilty of any of these would be tried.				 																																																	In the Sati Prevention Acts Section 2C, Sati means burning or burying alive of any widow along with the body of her deceased husband or with any article, object or thing associated with the husband, irrespective of whether such burning is voluntary on the part of the widow or otherwise.				 																																																	In the current case, a procession was taken out to glorify the sati after the act was committed. Rajasthan High Court had let off the accused on the technical-legal ground that once a prohibitory order is promulgated, the accused can be booked only under a provision other than the sati Act. 				 																HC boost to ayurveda				 																																																	 kochi (PTI): Kerala High Court has ruled that those without the necessary qualification and mandatory registration are not entitled to practise the Indian system of medicine in Kerala.				 																																																	The mandatory registration has to be under the Indian Medicine Central Council Act, 1970, or the Travancore Cochin Medical Practitioners Act, 1953, the court observed, while allowing two writ petitions.				 																Health staff sacked				 																																																	 aurangabad (PTI): The state health department has dismissed 36 Class III and IV employees from service on the ground of irregularities in their appointments while a probe was on against 60 others appointed between 1980 and 1990, sources said. The appointments were terminated after a probe found them illegal.				 																Unicef goods				 																																																	 Nashik (PTI): CBI officials have recovered freezers and stabilisers worth Rs 2 crore belonging to the Unicef during raids in Malegaon over the past two weeks, police said. A Bhiwandi-based transporter, instead of supplying the material to health organisations, had allegedly sold the consignment.				 																Naval shuffle				 																																																	 New Delhi (PTI): Vice-Admiral O.P. Bansal, director-general of Coast Guard, has been appointed commander-in-chief of the countrys first tri-service Andaman and Nicobar command. Vice-Admiral Suresh Mehta, chief of personnel at Naval Headquarters here, will replace Bansal while Vice-Admiral Yeshwant Prasad has been named chief of personnel, a defence ministry release said.				 																Z-cover for ex-cop				 																																																	 Mumbai (PTI): Former Mumbai police commissioner M.N. Singh has been placed under Z-category security following serious threat perceptions, the minister of state for home said. 				 																Simi arrest				 																																																	 bhopal (PTI): Khalid Naeem, former president of the Students Islamic Movement of Indias Bhopal district unit, was arrested here but later released on bail, police sources said.				 																																																	Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa has sanctioned Rs 5 lakh to the family of Palani, a forest guard, who was killed in an encounter in Tiruvannamalai in November 2001. During his service period, Palani had detected 59 sandalwood smuggling cases.
