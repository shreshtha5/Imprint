		 Wednesday, December 11, 2002 				 Short, sober tribute to House attack heroes
 SEEMA GUHA																								New Delhi, Dec. 10: The Centre has dropped plans to honour those who died defending Parliament, when it was attacked on December 13 last year, at a massive memorial service.																								The government fears it would send the wrong signal when security forces in Kashmir are still falling to militants bullets.																								The families of those killed would, however, get licences to set up petrol pumps. The letters of allotment would be handed to the family members in Parliament. It will be a short, sober affair, an aide to Speaker Manohar Joshi said.																								Joshi is said to have consulted leaders of all parties on ways to remember those who died defending politicians in the attack.																								The party leaders agreed with Joshis reluctance to go overboard with the memorial service. He apparently felt the country should not overstate the point.																								Our security forces have given their lives defending the country. Some have died on December 13, others later, a Parliament official said.																								Every other day, a policeman or a security personnel is being killed in Jammu and Kashmir. Can their sacrifices be forgotten?																								We cannot mark out for special treatment the people who died defending Parliamentarians, the official said.																								To commemorate the sacrifice of the seven men and one woman, MPs will observe a minutes silence and pay floral tribute at the plaque put up in their memory the same day this year.																								Verdict awaited																								A year after the attack on Parliament, a Delhi court may pronounce tomorrow its judgment in the case.																								Four persons, including two alleged Jaish-e-Mohammed militants and a suspended lecturer, have been tried under Pota for the December 13 attack. On November 25, special judge S.N. Dhingra reserved the order and fixed December 11 for pronouncement of the verdict.
