 Krishnagar, July 17: A slice of the silver screen to inject patriotism ? that is the BSFs plan of action.

 The force will screen films among border villagers to raise awareness about the soldiers role in war and peace. 

 The first lot of films the BSF has decided to screen includes Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose: A Forgotten Hero, LOC-Kargil, Border and Veer Zara. 

 Nadia would be the first district to get the filmi dose of love for the motherland. Later, films will also be shown in other border districts as well.

 Shyam Benegals Netaji will be shown in seven Nadia blocks along the border from next month.

 We are not saying that the border villagers are less patriotic than those in other parts of the country but, having known them, we feel some of them have close ties with the Bangladesh nationals. There are many reasons for such ties? most importantly, a degree of ignorance about their own country, said M. Ramaswami, the BSF deputy inspector-general in the Krishnagar sector. 

 The BSF and the border villagers often get involved in scraps with the jawans accusing them of smuggling and aiding infiltration and the residents raising a rumpus over their high-handedness. 

 The film shows, the BSF brass believe, will also help to bridge that divide. On an average 50 infiltrators are arrested in Nadia every month. A tension between the villagers and the BSF is palpable. So, we thought the time was ripe to make people understand why we had been deployed along the 2,100 km border, an officer said. 

 As an experiment, the Netaji film was shown at Gede earlier this month. We got a good response there and have decided to continue with the effort, said BSF inspector-general R.K. Pachnanda. 

 The villagers are also excited as they hardly get a chance to visit a cinema or grab a video show. Many still do not have television at home. 

 An officer said most border villagers do not have enough knowledge about the freedom struggle. They only have a very vague idea about heroes like Subhas Chandra Bose? Very few children living along the border know the names of freedom fighters.

 Films like LOC-Kargil and Border have been chosen to show the strenuous lives of the BSF and army personnel, the officer said. We are sure that after watching such movies on a regular basis, the villagers will understand us better and how important it is for them to help us to control infiltration and other border crimes.
