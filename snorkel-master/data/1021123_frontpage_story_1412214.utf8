The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage
 Saturday, November 23, 2002 				 Fault lies in House, not occupants 
 															- Wary of Left, Speaker sits on 10-page report with vastu remedies KAY BENEDICT				 	 A file picture of Parliament																								New Delhi, Nov. 22: Blame it on vastu, not Vajpayee.																								The untimely deaths of 13 sitting members, including then Speaker G.M.C. Balayogi, and the terrorist attack last December have spurred Speaker Manohar Joshi to seek refuge in vastu to set right the flaws in Parliament House.																								Joshi invited a vastu expert, Ashwinie Kumar Bansal, on October 16 and November 7 to ascertain vastu doshas (flaws) and suggest remedies. On his two visits, Bansal analysed the building and found serious flaws.																								He handed a 10-page report detailing the problems and suggesting remedies to the Speaker earlier this month. Joshis office is not willing to discuss the matter, and not unsurprisingly since the Speaker is not sure of the reaction of the Left parties to suggestions of vastu-friendly changes.																								According to Bansal, not only the string of tragedies but also the continuing friction inside the House between members and between parties and the inability of the political leadership to make the right decisions to take the country forward are a result of the negative energy emanating from the building.																								Bansal, a lawyer by profession and author of several books on vastu and feng shui, has studied the buildings that house legislatures in the US, UK, Pakistan, Russia and Germany. 																								He said he was horrified to find some major flaws in Parliament House which do not exist in any of the buildings he studied abroad.																								The trouble, he said, begins from the circular shape itself, which is good for a stadium but not for a legislature. The Gandhi statue erected in 1993 aggravated the bad effects and Bansal suggests barricading the area around it and erecting water fountains to absorb the negative energy. 																								Calling it an architectural blunder from the utility angle and the vastu angle, Bansal said the main fault of the building designed in 1921 by Lutyens and completed in 1927 is that it is round at the base and the top whereas the structures in other countries are either rectangular or square at base and square at the top. 																								Bansal said that in order to deliver good governance, a new Parliament with a square or rectangular structure has to be built. His suggestion is to convert the current building into a national museum and construct a new one at a cost of Rs 50 crore, or convert the Parliament annexe or Vigyan Bhavan, both vastu-friendly, into Parliament.																								The sitting arrangement inside the House is also faulty. The Lok Sabha chamber is shaped like a D, which is not good in vastu. Our Prime Minister sits in the northwest. It is the zone of air, and air has the quality of movement which creates pressure. He should sit in the middle, which is currently occupied by the ADMK and the TDP members and considered the best.																								He said the Speakers chair is right under the press gallery and that is why he is unable to control the members. In the Rajya Sabha, the chairman sits in a more vastu-friendly position without a gallery above him.																								In the Lok Sabhas semicircular arrangement, some of the ruling NDA members face east, some northeast and still others north. Bansal sees the root of division within the ruling combine in the seating arrangement. The Opposition, too, is split for the same reason.																								In the UK, ruling and opposition party members sit facing each other, which is considered perfect. In Russia, all members of the ruling party face one direction.
