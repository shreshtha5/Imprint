 Paris: France midfielder Claude Makelele has announced his retirement from international soccer to concentrate on his club career with Chelsea. ?I think that a player like me cannot afford to answer international calls if he is not going to play,? the defensive midfielder was quoted as saying by sports daily LEquipe on Saturday.

 ?I shall be 33 in 2006. It?s time to give way to the young generation of players like Benoit Pedretti. They need match experience before the next World Cup. My future is with Chelsea.?

 Makelele won 35 caps for France. At club level he won the French championship with Nantes in 1995 before moving to Spain where he won the championship in 2001 and 2003 and lifted the Champions League Trophy in 2002 with Real Madrid. He joined Chelsea in 2003 and has renewed his contract with the London club until 2008. 

 San Salvador: El Salvador fired coach Juan Ramon Paredes on Friday, two days after their 0-3 home defeat by Jamaica in a World Cup qualifier.

 ?We?ve concluded that, for various reasons, it?s not convenient for him to continue in charge of the national team,? El Salvador Football Federation president Humberto Torres said.

 Paredes, who took over two years ago, said he had made the best of what was available to him. ?I don?t feel bad because I have done the best with the players at my disposal,? he said. ?I don?t feel as if I?m owing anything.? 

 Berlin: German triathlete Katja Schumacher has been suspended from competition for one year for doping, the German triathlon federation said on Saturday. The 33-year-old Schumacher tested positive in Frankfurt on June 11 this year with her body showing levels of male hormone testosterone above the permitted threshold. 

 Nusa Dua: Extra security will be employed to protect players at next week?s WTA tournament in Bali in the wake of a bomb attack in Jakarta but last year?s winner Elena Dementieva will be a no show, organisers said on Saturday.

 World No. 6 Dementieva, who crushed American Chanda Rubin to take last year?s title, will be absent due to fatigue from Olympic and US Open appearances not terror fears, tournament director Kevin Livesey said.

 The tournament begins on Monday, just four days after a bomb attack on the Australian embassy in Jakarta killed nine people and injured 180. 

 Tournament operations manager H. K. Stefanus said extra security was being laid on to protect the players. ?Each player will be accompanied by security guards, from the airport to the hotel and during their activities,? he said. 

 New Delhi: India?s Sania Mirza moved into the singles final of the Asian tennis championship being played in Tashkent. The seventh-seeded Sania overpowered eighth-seeded Thai Napaporn Tongsalee 6-2, 6-4 in the semi-final on Saturday to remain on course for a wildcard for the Australian Open next year. 

 Hyderabad: India?s Ajay Ramaswamy and Mustafa Ghouse won the ITF men?s doubles title while Pakistan?s Aqeel Khan beat Liu Tai-wen (Chinese Taipei) to claim the singles title here.
