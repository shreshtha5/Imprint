																								Vancouver, Nov. 5 (Reuters): A Sikh activist charged with the 1985 Air-India bombings that killed 331 people said he was upset that more people did not die, a witness told a Canadian court yesterday.																								The witness said the alleged plotter, Ripudaman Singh Malik, gave her details of a plan to attack two Air-India jets, including Kanishka, when she confronted him in 1997 about reports that he was involved. 																								The Vancouver court has ordered that the witness, a woman who claims she was a love interest of Malik, not be identified.
