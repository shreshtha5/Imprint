Cold wave in Mysuru: Chimps get woollen blankets, big cats heaters.
With a cold wave gripping the city, heaters are keeping the large- and medium-sized carnivores warm at Mysuru zoo.
The drop in night temperatures has forced zoo keepers to boost the heat in the holding rooms of tigers, lions and leopards. Based on the night temperature, the room temperature of the animal holding rooms is artificially increased using heaters.
Chimpanzees have been given warm material such as woollen blankets to keep warm at night. Gunny bags too have been placed inside their rooms for the smart primates to crawl inside and sleep snugly.
Besides adjusting the temperature, the zoo authorities have also changed the the dietary plans of some animals to help them adjust to the fluctuating temperatures.
C. Ravishankar, the zoo’s executive director, told The Hindu that the zoo veterinarians were keeping an eye on the animals. All large carnivores such as tigers, lions and leopards are not being kept in the day crawl at night and are being let inside their holding rooms. But in the case of medium-sized carnivores such as wild dogs, hyenas and wolves, the animal gets to choose between staying outdoors in the open enclosure or going inside the holding room where heaters regulate the temperature. “We have kept woollen blankets inside the holding rooms of chimps. They sleep on the clothing to keep themselves warm. And the heaters are placed outside the animal holding rooms and are switched on for a specific period of time under the supervision of the keepers,” Mr. Ravishankar said.
However, over the past couple of days, the day temperatures have risen here, forcing the authorities to manage both the day and night temperatures.
Water jets, which are usually operated in the summer, are being used now to keep animals such as elephants and Indian gaur cool. Water is sprayed even on deers and sambars. If the day temperature is high, water jets are opened at lion enclosures too, the director added.
