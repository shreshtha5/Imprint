TITLE:6.0 earthquake strikes off coast of Ecuador

CONTENT:A magnitude 6.0 earthquake has struck off the coast of Ecuador in the same area where a deadly tremor left hundreds dead last year. President Lenin Moreno said there were no immediate reports of victims or major damages from the quake, which struck shortly after 6 am (1100 GMT) and was felt in 12 provinces across the country.

The US Geological Survey said the quake, with a depth of 25 kilometers, was centered around the town of San Vicente. More than 600 people were killed and thousands more injured when a 7.8 magnitude quake struck along Ecuadors Pacific coast in April 2016.

Authorities said that there wasnâ€™t a risk of a tsunami and appealed for calm.
