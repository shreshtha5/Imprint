TITLE:Twenty killed in Saudi-led airstrikes on Yemen’s Houthi depot

CONTENT:At least 20 Houthi rebels were killed on Sunday when Saudi-led coalition warplanes hit a missile depot in the Yemeni northwestern province of Hajjah, a Houthi security official told Xinhua. “Nearly 20 fighters were killed and some others wounded in the targeted site,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The depot exploded and caught fire after being hit by more than 10 airstrikes, the official said, without giving further details.

The depot is located in a small military camp run by Houthi rebels in the al-Raboo area in Abs district, which provides military supplies to the fighters in Medi town, which borders Saudi Arabia.

Sunday’s attack is the latest of a series of airstrikes carried out by the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthi rebels in a war of more than two and a half years. The new escalation of tension came six days after the Houthis killed former President Ali Abdullah Saleh who had shifted side to ally with the coalition.

The security situation in Sanaa has calmed down after the Houthis completely controlled the capital and defeated Saleh’s armed supporters. The capital’s residents began gradually returning to the markets and streets, as state employees resumed work in the ministries.
