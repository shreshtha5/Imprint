	With the sentencing of Ajmal Kasab, India has taken the first step towards coming to terms with the memory of a horrific injustice perpetrated on it for over three fateful days two years ago. The award of four death penalties and five life sentences to the lone terrorist apprehended after the Mumbai carnage may seem to be particularly vindictive. But there should be little ground for remorse, and not merely because the verdict may appear to be commensurate with the crime committed  seven murders, 159 assisted murders, apart from the other lesser charges. What has to be kept in mind is that Indias triumph lies not in sentencing Kasab to death, but in successfully conducting and concluding a trial amid intense public pressure and immense international interest. Both the trial and the verdict have been exemplary. Even in the face of extreme provocation, India has followed the due process of law in the most transparent manner possible. And the verdict was arrived at only after the careful inspection of voluminous data in the form of oral and forensic evidence, legally admissible communication intercepts, DNA samples, and the convicts own retracted statement.        
	The award of capital punishment to Kasab is bound to raise uncomfortable questions about Indias humanity, particularly in the face of the complete lack of it in the perpetrators of the mindless violence of 26/11. But it has to be remembered that the law of the land reserves this extreme form of punishment for the rarest of rare cases, and Kasabs surely was one of them. Kasab and his teammates had been waging a war against India, and are enemies of the State and its people. The judge of the special sessions court, M.L. Tahaliyani, is himself sufficiently convinced of the inhumanity of the convict to claim that he is undeserving of sympathy. Despite Kasabs brutality, however, the law will allow him enough opportunity to seek reprieve in the form of appeal in the higher courts, and then before the president of the country. Whatever Kasabs ultimate fate  the gallows or life sentences in perpetuity  India should not lose sight of the fact that he is among the lesser minions who are marched to the war front by masterminds sitting far away from the country. The latter require as much doggedness from the Indian administration to be brought to book like Kasab. Their conduits within the country too should not go scot-free.
