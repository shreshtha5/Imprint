The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | the games up
                                                                                                                 THE GAMES UP                                                    
	They did not take two days. They took less than two minutes to turn the joke on Pakistan. The attack on the convoy of Sri Lankan cricketers in Lahore that left many dead and some of the players seriously injured took place despite the Pakistan governments promise of maximum security for the sportsmen. The gunmen, almost photocopies of the Mumbai assailants, made a mockery of that pledge when they congregated in rickshaws, cars, and perhaps even on foot, in that high-security zone to accomplish their task. And they withdrew from the scene of crime  unharmed and undeterred  after having left another indelible stamp of their marksmanship and audacity. Cricketers have never been directly targeted before in the history of the game, and it is likely that Lahore 2009, like the 1972 Munich Olympics, will be remembered with shame in the years to come. This shame, though, will have its own use for the perpetrators of the crime. The isolation of Pakistan in the game  an inevitable outcome of the serious security threat to players and the failure of the government to remedy the situation  will turn the nation further inwards and provide grist to the jihadi mill.         
	That this is already happening is evident from the way Pakistan has chosen to react to the incident. While condemning it, the Pakistan prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, announced that the attack had been carried out to give the country a bad name. Mr Gilani should realize that the conspirators are within his own State, dallying with security personnel and trying to undermine his own government; they are not being exported by a country across the Wagah border. Unless he acknowledges this, he will neither be able to track down gunmen who disappear into the crowd nor bring international cricket back to his country. It is a positive development that the government of Punjab, where the crime took place, has noted the consanguinity of Mumbai and Lahore. This could lead to only one end  a thorough investigation of suspects following the trails of both Mumbai and Lahore, irrespective of where they lead. So far, Pakistan has steadfastly stonewalled all international attempts to interrogate suspects who are in government custody. It is possible that international pressure following the Lahore attack will finally push Pakistan to clean up its own stables.
