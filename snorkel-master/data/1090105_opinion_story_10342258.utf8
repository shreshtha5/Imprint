	The home minister has been consoling. If this time the police in Assam could not get their hands on the prospective bombers in spite of prior warning, the next time they will. The families of those dead in Guwahati, on October 30, 2008 and again on January 1, 2009 might ask what next time means. With just a little bit of luck, claim the police, they would have caught the United Liberation Front of Asom member who was actually named by the Centre as the main executor of the planned New Years Day attack. How much more luck do they need, just two months after the October 30 blasts, with the intervening attack on Mumbai? Even the devastating blasts in October during the festive season could have been predicted and prepared for, particularly since the whole nation was supposed to have been on high alert because terrorists and militants from within and outside India were managing almost one series of blasts a month.        
	It is pointless to keep looking back when the country is trying to deal with violence and terror. But amnesia will not help, because the repeated analyses of earlier incidents is one way of preparing for the future. Certainly there were some differences this time. The Centre had very specific information and had let the state government know. The police did get moving, and it may have been because of their alertness that the spots most inviting for militants, where they could have caused maximum bloodshed, escaped being blasted. Yet this is not enough; just too many people have died, in Assam and elsewhere, and have been dying for too long a time, for success to be measured against a benchmark of earlier failures. Five people died this time, and 62 were injured. That is still a very heavy price. A little bit of luck might have helped the police, but a lot more than luck is needed to seek out and address the causes of violence and to predict and prevent attacks in each state and in every region of the country.
