Indian-origin man dies in US store shooting.
Washington, February 9.
An Indian-American was killed and another critically injured when a man opened fire in two convenience stores in the US state of Georgia.
Paramjit Singh, a 44-year-old father of two high school students, was shot multiple times on Tuesday evening at the Hi Tech Quick Stop on Burnett Ferry Road.  Just 10 minutes after shooting Singh, the gunman entered another convenience store and stole money before shooting 30-year-old clerk Parthey Patel. He was in a critical condition.
The suspect, Lamar Rashad Nicholson, 28, was arrested on multiple charges, including murder, aggravated robbery, aggravated assault, possession of a firearm and use of a firearm by a convicted felon.
Major Jeff Jones said a security video showed the suspect walking into the store and immediately firing three shots at Singh. There was no attempt to rob the store. Police are probing the motive.
Singh’s brother, who owns several local businesses, said his elder brother came to the area eight years ago. — PTI
