Fire guts office in GHMC in Hyderabad.
A fire was reported early on Tuesday in the GHMC’s Central Zone office, gutting most of the office’s audit room.
Firemen rushed to the spot to find the flames burning for about an hour before operations could begin. Two fire tenders fought the fire in the three-floor building for an hour to douse it.
This is the second reported instance of a fire in government office in the last two weeks. On January 24, the first floor of Road Transport Authority’s office, incidentally also in Khairatabad, went up in flames. Like the RTA fire, Tuesday’s fire in GHMC office was also blamed on faulty wiring.
A police complaint was registered to enquire if it was a case of sabotage as the fire took place in the audit room where files pertaining to inquiries, bills and other crucial documents are placed.
Besides the GHMC fire accident, another minor fire accident came to light on Wednesday. The incident occurred at the under-construction Hitech City Metro Rail Station on Tuesday when welding work led to sparks and a small fire, which was doused by persons working at the spot.
