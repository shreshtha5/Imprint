TITLE:Three soldiers, beacon men die in avalanches 
CONTENT:Avalanches in border areas of Uri and Tangdar killed three soldiers and three labourers of Border Roads Organsation on Wednesday.
Police said that four soldiers of the Army's 7-Maratha, who were on patrol duty, were overrun by an avalanche at Dhaki Bahak near border village Bijhama in Uri sector.
Defence spokesperson Col Hemant Joneja said that all the four were retrieved from the snow in unconscious condition. "They were rushed to hospital but three of them died on way", he said.
The condition of the fourth jawan was stated to be critical.
In a separate incident, a vehicle carrying two labourers of the Border Roads Organisation was hit by an avalanche at Sadhna top on Kupwara-Karnah road, killing the two labourers and driver of the vehicle.
Police said that the vehicle had fallen deep into a ravine, and search for the bodies of the two labourers and the driver was on.
The valley's highlands have been witnessing heavy snowfall for the past three days, which has resulted in the closure of many roads including Srinagar-tangdar road. Police said that the labourers were working on the road to reopen it.
