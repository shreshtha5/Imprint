The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, September 26, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																3000 letters in 6 days for LIC client				 																																																	Chandigarh (PTI): A branch of the Life Insurance Corporation in Punjab has sent 3,000 reminders to a policy holder, incurring postage charges of Rs 15,000.				 																																																										Narender Kumar, who had purchased a policy worth Rs 50,000 in 2002 with a quarterly premium of Rs 592, said LICs Mohali office had been flooding him with hundreds of letters a day over the past six days, reminding him that his premium was due.				 																																																										I received nearly 3,000 mailers during the past six days from LIC. The postman has been delivering hundreds of reminders a day from LIC for the next premium payment, says Kumar, who works at a shop here. He, however, claimed that he paid his premiums on time and had cleared the last one in August.				 																																																										LIC officials said a computer glitch might have triggered the mailing madness.				 																																																	sked why the error had not been detected when bundles of mail were being sent to a single address, an official said: We have a mass mailing arrangement with the post and telegraph department.... LIC is examining the whole thing; the matter has been referred to our IT branch to see what exactly went wrong.				 																Fee row stalls Kanishka trial				 																																																	Vancouver (PTI): The Kanishka trial has been adjourned for a week following a dispute over who would pay the legal fees of one of the key accused in the case. 				 																																																										British Columbia Supreme Court judge Ian Josephson granted the adjournment on Thursday to allow the government and lawyers for millionaire Ripudaman Singh Malik, one of the main accused in the Air-India flight 182 bombing case, to work out a temporary deal to pay for Maliks 11-member defence team. 				 																																																										Its most regrettable that the trial is being adjourned in this fashion, Josephson said. The interest of justice requires that this issue be resolved with haste so that trial can proceed. 				 																																																										The trial was adjourned at the request of Maliks lawyer, media reports here said.				 																																																										Both Malik and Kamloops millworker Ajaib Singh Bagri face first-degree murder and conspiracy charges in the case. The flight crashed off the Irish coast on June 23, 1985, killing all 329 on board. The two are also charged in the deaths of two baggage handlers the same day at Tokyos Narita airport due to a bomb blast.				 																																																										Last week, Judge Sunni Stromberg Stein had denied Malik further legal aid, saying he could afford to pay for his own defence and was not as broke as he claimed to be. Malik has already received $3.6 million from the government for his lawyers in what is dubbed as the most complex and expensive trial in Canadian history. 				 																Shrine notice to Mumbai body				 																																																	Mumbai (PTI): Bombay High Court has directed the BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation to take action in accordance with law and file an action-taken report within two months regarding the 854 illegally constructed shrines in the metropolis.				 																																																										The directive was issued on a petition by Janhit Manch and its president Bhagwanji Raiyani challenging the mushrooming of such shrines. The PIL was deferred to November 12 to enable the civic body to file the report.				 																ISI aide arrested				 																																																	Ghaziabad (PTI): An alleged associate of an Inter-Services Intelligence agent, entrusted with the job of preparing maps of the Hindon air base, has been arrested from Loni near here, police said. Ijaz was an associate of ISI agent Harinarayan Shah, who had been arrested last week by Gujarat police. Both of them belonged to Nepal.				 																Salman charges				 																																																	Mumbai (PTI): A magistrate will frame charges on Friday against Salman Khan in a hit-and-run case. This will begin the trial one year after the actor rammed his vehicle into a bakery, killing one person and injuring four. 				 																Modified Cheetah				 																																																	Bangalore (PTI): Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd is developing a modified version of its workhorse Cheetah helicopters, designed to carry heavy payloads in high altitudes, including the Siachen glacier, said company sources.				 																Emergency landing				 																																																	ahmedabad: A helicopter carrying 10 journalists to Somnath to cover deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advanis visit there developed a technical snag, forcing an emergency landing in Upleta near Rajkot. Advani had flown in another Indian Air Force helicopter to Somnath to celebrate the anniversary of the 1989 rath yatra. No one was injured.				 																Woman, kin killed				 																																																	Dehra Dun (PTI): A woman in her early 20s was allegedly raped and then killed along with her father and brother in Roorkee town of Hardwar, police said. Investigations revealed that Rekha Pandey was raped before the three were poisoned and strangulated.																		Dandia queen Falguni Pathak has teamed up with People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta), urging people to go veg for 365 days and not merely for the nine days of Navratri. Falguni features in an e-card available on the Peta website.
