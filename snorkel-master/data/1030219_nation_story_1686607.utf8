		 Wednesday, February 19, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																3 die as cloudburst ravages Gujarat				 																																																	 AHMEDABAD: Two women and a four-year-old boy were killed and 19 others injured after a cloudburst in north Gujarat on Tuesday, reports our correspondent. 				 																																																	The cloudburst triggered an unusually heavy rainfall of 7.6 mm that was accompanied by high-speed winds.				 																																																	The four-year-old boy was killed in Amja village and the two women at Goletar village in Gandhinagar district and at Dedhal village in Banaskantha district. The 19 people who were injured when their houses collapsed were rushed to the Gandhinagar civil hospital.				 																																																	The cloudburst, which the meteorological department claimed was not unusual, was followed by high velocity winds that extensively damaged some villages in Gandhinagar district. The department said the cloudburst could be attributed to the low pressure development in western Madhya Pradesh and north Gujarat.				 																																																	Hundreds of trees were uprooted triggering traffic snarls in the affected region.				 																																																	Police faced the wrath of residents in Goletar village, near Gandhinagar, when they reached around 3.30 pm to rescue a woman trapped in a house. When the police tried to persuade the villagers to let them work, they were resisted and pelted with stones. The police had to use mild force to disperse the villagers.				 																Court boost for plot holders				 																																																	 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has ruled that a coloniser cannot ask plot holders to contribute towards construction of community services even though it was entitled to recover the development cost from them.				 																																																	The ruling was given by a bench of Justices S.B. Sinha and A. Lakshmanan while allowing DLF Qutab Enclave Complex Educational Charitable Trust to have rights over the land given to it by DLF Universal for setting up schools in Gurgaon.				 																																																	The court rejected the Haryana governments stand that DLF Universal could not create a third party interest on the land given to it as a coloniser for construction of schools. 				 																																																	DLF had invited educational societies to do the needful after transferring the right of land to them.				 																																																	The cost of development works indisputably is to be raised from the plot holders, but as construction of schools, hospitals, community centres and other community buildings do not come within the purview of the term development works, the costs therefore are not to be borne by them, Sinha said. 				 																House attack accused plea				 																																																	 NEW DELHI (PTI): Jaish-e-Mohammad militant Mohammad Afzal, sentenced to death in the Parliament attack case, has raised several additional grounds in his appeal in Delhi High Court.				 																																																	Afzal has alleged that he did not get free trial and the police action forcing him to make a statement before the media after his arrest had prejudiced trial proceedings. 				 																																																	The court has issued notice to the prosecution on his application. Prosecution counsel Mukta Gupta said Afzals application should be heard along with the main appeals for which a date for hearing has yet to be fixed.				 																Mini jail uprising				 																																																	 Coimbatore (PTI): An assistant jailer and three wardens in the Central prison were injured when angry undertrials attacked them for stopping a colleague, belonging to the Tamil National Liberation Army, from meeting up with another in an adjacent block. 				 																Hunt for killer				 																																																	 Ahmedabad (PTI): Rural police are on the trail of a physical training coach, alleged to be the prime accused in the murder of his wife Sajni, who was strangulated on the night of February 14. Tarun Ginraj has reportedly been absconding after he took cash from his house and left for some undisclosed place two days ago.				 																New Isro facility				 																																																	 Bhopal (PTI): The countrys second master control facility will be set up here by the Indian Space Research Organisation to enhance its satellite monitoring capability. 				 																Gulf students				 																																																	 New Delhi (PTI): The CBSE has made alternative arrangements for students in the Gulf to enable them to appear in the exams in case of possible military strike on Iraq.
