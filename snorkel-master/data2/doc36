The girl, whose name is being withheld, was transported to hospital where she was pronounced dead.

With winds of up to 60mph (100km/h), the storm is causing severe disruption for commuters across many parts of the north-east, and authorities in several states are advising residents to stay off the roads.

In all, about 50 million people across the country have been warned about the severe weather. There has also been heavy snow in other parts of the country. In the state of Wisconsin, four people aged over 60 died in separate incidents while shovelling snow, according US media.
