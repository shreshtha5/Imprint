TITLE:Six coaches of Manduadih Express derail in New Delhi.
CONTENT:Six coaches of the New Delhi-Manduadih Express derailed soon after departing from New Delhi station on Thursday night, police said.

But since the train was moving slowly at the time of the accident, no one was hurt, said Parwaiz Ahmed, DCP (Railways).

The derailment of the 12582 New Delhi- Manduadih Superfast train happened between 10.30pm and 10.45pm after it departed from platform number 13, the DCP said.

“Most of the passengers in the six affected bogies had gone to sleep,” said the officer.
