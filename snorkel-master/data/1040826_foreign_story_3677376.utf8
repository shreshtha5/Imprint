 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Chechens deny hand
				 	 A relative cries at Domodevo airport, Moscow. (AFP)																								London, Aug. 25 (Reuters): A London-based spokesman for the leader of Chechnyas main rebel group said today it was not responsible for near-simultaneous air crashes in Russia which killed 89 people.																								Asked if his group was responsible for the crashes, Akhmed Zakayev, a spokesman for Chechnyas separatist leader Aslan Maskhadov, said in London: Of course not.																								To us any form of terrorism is absolutely unacceptable. We have condemned it and continue to condemn it, he said. Two Russian passenger planes crashed almost simultaneously late yesterday, killing all 89 people on board in what investigators said was probably a freak coincidence but might have been a terrorist attack.																								The planes took off from the same Moscow airport and disappeared from air traffic controllers radar screens within minutes of each other late yesterday. The crash sites were some 800 km apart.																								The incidents came against a backdrop of mounting violence in Chechnya, where Moscow has been battling separatists for a decade. 																								In the past Chechen rebels have blamed extremist Chechens for attacks on civilians such as a deadly hostage crisis in a Moscow theatre in 2002, but Zakayev said he did not think such people were responsible in this case.																								Even those Chechens who have been driven to such desperate methods as suicide, I think even they have realised that this brings no benefits to the Chechen people, he said. So I rule that out.																								Yesterday, a blast from a device planted near a bus stop in southern Moscow injured at least 3 people, city police said.																								Police said no one was killed in the explosion which happened at around 1545 GMT. They were unable to give further details. Interfax quoted a police source as saying that the explosive device was attached to a street light close to the bus stop. There was no indication as to who may have planted the device.
