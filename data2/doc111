earthquake in delhi.
Delhi, the capital city of India, is bounded by the Indo-Gangetic alluvial plains in the North and East, by Thar desert in the West and by Aravalli hill ranges in the South. It falls under Zone - IV in the country-wide macro earthquake zone (Zone V -high intensity to Zone II - low intensity). Though it may not fall in the most seismically active region of the country, the city can still face disastrous consequences if any earthquake strikes with its epicentre anywhere in the surrounding areas such as Hindukush mountain range or the Himalayas.
A report on 'seismic hazard microzonation of Delhi' by ministry of earth sciences indicates that areas like Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), AIIMS, Chhatarpur and Naraina fall under the safest zone while the high risk zone, mostly in patches, are concentrated in east, central and northern parts. Areas including Hauz Khas and Vasant Kunj are also among the low hazard zone.
The map shows that Delhi University's north campus, Sarita Vihar, Gita Colony, Shakarpur, Paschim Vihar, Wazirabad, Rithala, Rohini, Jahangirpuri, Bawana, Karol Bagh and Janakpuri fall under the 'high hazard zone' having worst category of "very high" risk index. Most of these areas are along the bank of the river Yamuna and its flood plain. On the other hand, places like IGI Airport, Hauz Khas, Burari and Najafgarh fall under second worst "high risk" index category.
