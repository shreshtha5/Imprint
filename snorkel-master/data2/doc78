TITLE:Hailstorm gives heavy damage to crops in Chamba region

CONTENT:Dharamshala: Mild snowfall and heavy hailstorm have destroyed crops in Kihar and Dand area of Chamba region. French beans and pea plants are the two major farm products here and most of the farmers of this region depend on them. The rainfall started on Friday evening, followed by heavy hailstorm.

Pradhan of Dand village Kanta Devi said that farmers had met her and demanded to raise the issue with the administration to seek relief for their damages. "I would take up this matter with the authorities concerned," she said.


Manzoor Pathan, a farmer of the region, said that around 150 farmers were dependent on these crops. "The losses are heavy. We hope that the department concerned would soon provide relief to the farmers," Pathan said.


Pradhan of Kihar Baby Magra said that last year the produce had yielded around Rs 150 crore for the farmers of the area.
