TITLE:UP train accident toll climbs to 150.
CONTENT:According to railway officials, 52 people were admitted to hospital, with a dozen of the injured passengers still critical.

Officials said that so far 143 bodies had been identified and handed over to the kin. Seven bodies are yet to be identified. The family members of two passengers have lodged a missing report at the Akbarpur police station, they said.

Over 50 railway staff, including gate-men, gang-men, technical personnel and the running staff on the train, have so far been quizzed by the probe team.

Train services on the Jhansi-Kanpur route, which had been closed following the accident, resumed on Tuesday, though the trains were allowed to pass at a slow speed on the repaired tracks, officials said.

As many as 14 coaches had derailed a few metres from the Pukharayan railway station in the district at dawn on Sunday, killing 150 people and leaving 200 wounded.
