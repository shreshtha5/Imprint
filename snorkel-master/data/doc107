Naval officer rams into parked truck on Mumbai-Pune Expressway, dies.
NAVI MUMBAI: A 26-year-old navy lieutenant posted at INS Shivaji in Lonavla died of head injuries after his car rear-ended into a truck parked illegally in the third lane of the Mumbai-Pune Expressway early on Sunday.
Police suspect the victim, Srikanth Obaya Nagipogu, who was returning to Lonavla after a meeting in Mumbai, might have not seen the truck as it was dark and crashed into it JUST ahead of Bhatan tunnel near Kon village.
Panvel taluka police arrested the truck driver, Dilawar Hamid Patel (42), who hails from Karad, and booked him under the Indian Penal Code for causing death by negligence and rash driving among other charges. Motorists are prohibited from halting their vehicle on the Expressway.
"Patel claimed that he pulled into the extreme left lane on the Pune carriageway as he suspected his truck had developed some mechanical fault," said police sub-inspector Nilesh Taru. "Patel claimed he was under the truck checking for any faults, when the car crashed into his vehicle from behind around 3.30am. He said as he could not remove the driver from the car, which was badly mangled, he waited for police to arrive." The highway safety patrol police reached the spot minutes after receiving the information from the control room.
"We suspect the truck driver had parked his vehicle to take a nap. But as there are no other witnesses, we cannot confirm it," said Tare. "If he was feeling sleepy, he should have parked his vehicle in the service lane, and not the third lane."
After post-mortem, police handed over Nagipogu's body to his brother in the presence of naval officers. "The brother has taken the body to their home town in Andhra Pradesh's Kadapa district for the final rites," said police sub-inspector Neelam Pawar.
