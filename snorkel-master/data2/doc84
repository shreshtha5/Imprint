TITLE:Heatwave claims 84 more lives in Andhra Pradesh 

CONTENT:Even as welcome showers brought much-needed relief in some parts of Andhra Pradesh, the toll due to heatwave mounted to 1401, with 84 sun-stroke deaths being reported on Monday.

According to Relief Commssionerate's office, the sun-stroke deaths were reported from three districts -- Prakash 40, Warangal 22 and Adilabad 22.

The temperature, which had soared to 48 degress Celsius, now ranged from 38 to 41 degress C, the weather office said.

The worst-affected districts are West Godavari with 261 deaths, followed by East Godavari 199, Nalgonda 192 and Guntur 184.

The state capital, which has been in the grip of an unprecedented heatwave, is facing acute shortage of drinking water following failure of monsoon for two consecutive years, which has resulted in drying up of the city's two main water sources- Osmansagar and Himayatsagar.

However, the State Government has drawn up a contingency plan to tap the Krishna river waters and meet the requirements in the city by next March, official sources said.
