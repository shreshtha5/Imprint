6.1 earthquake jolts northern India, tremors felt in Delhi-NCR.
NEW DELHI: A 6.1 magnitude earthquake on the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border region on Wednesday shook several parts of north India, including the national capital and the Kashmir Valley, the met department said.
The quake, which was felt in the Delhi-NCR region as well as the Kashmir Valley, led to panic in some parts with people rushing outdoors for safety.
There were no reports of any damage due to the earthquake, officials said.
"The epicentre of the quake was near the Afghanistan- Tajikistan border and occurred at a depth of around 190 kilometres," an official said in Srinagar.
In New Delhi, Delhi Metro trains were halted briefly but services were not disrupted, said a Delhi Metro official.
The tremors were felt strongly in the Valley, with people rushing out of buildings and vehicles.
Officials snapped electricity supply briefly as a precautionary measure.
For many people in Kashmir, the tremors recalled the nightmare of the October 2005 earthquake that flattened wide parts of Jammu and Kashmir on either side of the Line of Control.
