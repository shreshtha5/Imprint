				 Unity call for terror fight
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 26: Home minister Shivraj Patil today promised more funds to battle the scourge of terrorism but said the need of the hour was unity among all political parties and a true federal spirit.																								Patil, who was responding to an impromptu Lok Sabha discussion on Fridays blasts in Uttar Pradesh, said the states and the Centre needed to work together as merely enhancing the budget for policing and better equipment would not suffice.																								He said the Centre would call a meeting of chief ministers within two weeks to discuss the problem and draw up plans to strengthen the intelligence network.																								Patil cautioned that total reliance on the Intelligence Bureau would not help as the central agency did not have the manpower to gather information from lakhs of villages and towns. 																								The only solution, the Union minister added, was to strengthen the special branches of state police.																								The minister asked the states to properly utilise funds given for police modernisation and rued the lack of consensus on a federal agency to tackle terror crimes. He also said the police-population ratio in India was pathetic compared with global standards.																								Most Opposition members criticised what they called the governments lackadaisical approach, including those from the ruling combine who felt there was an urgent need for strengthening the intelligence-gathering machinery.																								Some members criticised the Centres politics of minority appeasement and alleged that the indecision over hanging Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru was sending out wrong messages to terrorists.																								BJP spokesperson Vijay Kumar Malhotra later said at a news conference that states like Uttar Pradesh had become breeding grounds for sleeper terror cells and modules of Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence and the governments response had not been adequate at all.
