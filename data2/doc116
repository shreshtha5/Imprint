TOKYO: A volcano northwest of here erupted on Tuesday, the Japanese Met office said, triggering a nearby avalanche. Some 15 persons were injured in the eruption, while four were caught in the avalanche.
Mount Kusatsu-Shirane in Gunma erupted triggering the avalanche in the neighbouring Kusatsu International Ski Resort in Kusatsu-machi, a firefighter involved in rescue operation told Xinhua news agency.
