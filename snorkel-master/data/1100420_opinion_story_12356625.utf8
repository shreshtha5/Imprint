	There is perhaps nothing in the United Nations inquiry commission report on the assassination of Benazir Bhutto that is not known already. It has been obvious since the death of Pakistans former prime minister on December 27, 2007, that the 15-year-old suicide bomber, who hit her cavalcade, had not acted alone, and that the Pervez Musharraf administration had failed to ensure foolproof security. But certain things needed to be written in black-and-white, and this would have been impossible, given the circumstances in Pakistan, without the pen being wielded by an independent investigating authority like the UN. The report indicts the intelligence agencies in Pakistan for not only being unable to prevent the assassination but also for thwarting the investigation. The provincial administration, the report says, did not act independently of higher authorities, prevented a post-mortem being conducted on the dead leader, and then obliterated evidence by hosing down the site of crime. The higher authorities, subsequently, prejudiced the investigation by putting the blame on the Taliban leader, Baitullah Mehsud (who was not even investigated), and conducted a separate investigation whose details were never brought to the public domain.         
	The higher authority is the Pakistan army, which is in nexus with intelligence agencies and the bureaucracy to retain its overpowering presence in the Pakistani establishment. Unfortunately, the UN commission does not have the brief to go after it. That job has to be done by the Pakistan government if it wants to carry the investigation to its logical end. But there are enough doubts about its intentions already. To start with, Mr Musharraf has been given safe passage out of the country, and by none other than the government headed by the widower of Benazir Bhutto. There have also been efforts by the government to postpone the announcement of the conclusions of the report. The report obviously does not make it comfortable. Other than pointing fingers at higher authorities, it incriminates the Pakistan Peoples Party as well, particularly some members who hold prominent positions now. Further investigation could lead to more skeletons or reveal uglier nexuses. That is probably why such a no-holds-barred report has been greeted with so much scepticism in Pakistan. No one hopes it will lead the nation any closer to, or further from, the truth.
