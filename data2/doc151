Several hurt in shooting near US spy agency
Fort Meade, February 14.
Several persons were injured during a Wednesday morning shooting at the US National Security Agency headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland.
The incident occurred when a vehicle tried to enter the US Army installation that houses the agency without authorisation. Shots were fired but that none of the injuries appeared to have been caused by gunshots.
The statement did not make clear whether the shots had been fired by a suspect or by law enforcement and officials at the NSA and Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is probing the incident, did not respond to questions about who fired weapons.
“Weapons were discharged in the course of the incident, which remains under investigation. The situation is under control and there is no ongoing security of safety threat,” the agency said in a statement. — Reuters
