3 students killed as truck crashes into motorcycle.
COIMBATORE: Three students were killed and four others injured in a road accident involving two trucks and as many motorcycles on L&T Bypass Road near Chettipalayam on the outskirts of the city on the early hours of Saturday.
The deceased were identified as B Karthi, 20, and his relatives S Saravanan, 20 and K Ashwin, 20, all natives of Poonthottam in Viluppuram district. Karthi was a third year BE student of Hindustan Engineering College at Othakkalmandapam, while Saravanan and Ashwin were students of a private polytechnic college in Viluppuram district.
The trio was heading to Karthi's rental room at Malumichampatti when the accident took place. Karthi's classmates R Muneeswaran, 20, a native of Ramanathapuram district, S Hulsan Kumar, 20, of Trichy, and S Immanuel Richard, 20, of Nagapattinam, were following them on another two-wheeler.
When they neared Kallankadu Thottam at Chettipalayam, a speeding truck laden with domestic gas cylinders rammed the motorcycle in which Karthi and his relatives were travelling. In the impact, the trio was thrown off the motorcycle and they were later run over by the truck. The trio died on the spot.
The truck then rammed the motorcycle in which Karthi's friends were travelling. The trio sustained injuries to their knee, forehead and legs. The truck came to halt after colliding with another truck, which was laden with iron sheets. The LPG gas truck driver, identified as K Govindaraj, 66, of Salem, also sustained injuries in the incident.
When alerted, the Chettipalayam police rushed to the spot and sent the injured to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) and two private hospitals. The bodies were sent to the CMCH for postmortem. The bodies were handed over to the family members of the deceased on Saturday afternoon.
The Chettipalayam police registered a case against the truck driver, Govindaraj, and further investigation is on. "The truck laden with domestic LPG cylinders was on its way to Salem from Kochi when it rammed the motorcycles," the police said.
