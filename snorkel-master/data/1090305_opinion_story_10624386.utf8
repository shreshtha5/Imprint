	As the world assesses the damage inflicted by the deadly ambush on cricketers in Lahore, it may find that cricket is only one of the games that has been affected. The furore over the incident is bound to bring to the fore another triangular series that is being played away from the public eye. The results of this other match were evident in the gusto with which the Sri Lankan government declared that its diplomatic ties with Pakistan will not be affected by the attack while the Pakistan government accused the enemy of Pakistan-Sri Lanka ties of masterminding the plan to ambush the cricketers. It is not difficult to see that fingers are being pointed at India, the third party in this subcontinental game.         
	Pakistans congenital hatred of its neighbour and Sri Lankas acquired distaste of India, following the latters meddling in the Sri Lankan Tamil issue, have brought Pakistan and Sri Lanka closer. Pakistan has extended its helping hand to Sri Lanka whenever Indias has gone missing. Arms assistance has been one such area. Ever since India decided to replace its strategy of supplying arms to Sri Lanka with the soft option of providing military training and cooperation in intelligence and naval surveillance (to deflect domestic political pressure), Pakistan and China have stepped in to fill that void. Sri Lankas arms procurement from Pakistan has reached unprecedented heights recently. Without the supplies of ammunition, aerial bombs and rocket launchers from its neighbours, Sri Lanka perhaps would not have been able to triumph over the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Little wonder that the Sri Lankan cricket team dared where the Indians had feared to venture. The attack on the cricketers will not change bilateral relations. It will only deepen suspicion against India, long seen as the regional bully. As India nags both nations  Sri Lanka to settle the Tamil issue and Pakistan to bring the Mumbai suspects to book  the bonhomie may even increase. Cricket, of course, will not be a part of this game.
