	It is impossible to say if Australia, or any of the big Western nation-states, was a friendlier place to immigrate to some 50 years back. As late as the 1960s, segregation was fiercely enforced in the United States of America, Britain resented the steady influx of settlers from its former colonies, and South Africa embraced apartheid with gusto. In the 1980s, Indians in New Jersey were singled out for severe humiliation by the dotbusters, while Punjabis in Canada faced regular street violence. It is possible that far too many other instances of racial abuse were quietly ignored  because of the sufferers forbearance or perhaps because these incidents merely involved verbal insult, not physical aggression. It was only after 9/11 that the can of worms burst open and the shameful secrets of the civilized West tumbled out of the closet. However, it is still premature to even begin to think of a racially equitable world, even in that seat of enlightenment, Europe. For more than a year now, Indians, particularly students, have encountered gruesome attacks in various Australian cities. In the latest instance, a young man from Punjab was stabbed to death in Victoria, which, the Australian authorities insist, is one of their safest cities. That is the usual spiel. Every time Indians are targeted, Australians condemn the attacks earnestly, India grumbles out its concerns without much effect, investigations are carried out, and families compensated  but the stage when a crime can be unqualifiedly labelled as racially motivated never quite arrives.        
	Apart from the usual lack of evidence, there is another painfully unsettling dimension to these racist attacks. Educated, respectable, white-collar Indians are discovering themselves, with evident consternation, to be at the receiving end of a societys hate, which has been so far directed mostly at Muslims and illegal immigrants. Under the levelling glare of the Western eye, brown skin starts losing its good and bad shades  Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis look all the same. Racism is too primal, too pervasive, an ethos embedded in the very foundation of Western civilization. Law can never eradicate it; legislations merely put the fear of punishment into the minds of criminals. Only a more profound change of heart can turn racism into a thing of the inglorious past. As long as immigrants do not feel safe in their own skin in foreign lands, no law can ensure their safety.
