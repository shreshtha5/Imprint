Road contractor's employee killed by Naxals in Chhattisgarh's Dantewada.
RAIPUR: Naxals killed a 24-year-old man, employee of a road contractor, in Chhattisgarh's Dantewada district on Sunday.
The deceased man's 10-year-old sister-in-law was also injured in the incident at Gatam village under Katekalyan police station limits, a local police official told PTI.
Manoj Podiyam (24), the deceased, was working as an accountant ('munshi') with a private contractor engaged in road construction work in the area.
Naxals stormed into Podiyam's house at Gatam, around 400 km from here, last night, and shot him in front of his wife, the official said.
Podiyam's sister-in-law Muskan Mandavi (10) was hit in the leg by a ricocheting bullet.
After receiving information, a police team reached the spot and shifted the injured girl to a local hospital.
"Her condition is stable," said the police official, adding that a combing operation has been launched in the region to trace the assailants.
