																								Vancouver, Sept. 18 (PTI): Government prosecutors in the Kanishka case claimed they had two key witnesses who would decisively link the accused to the 1985 mid-air explosion of the Air-India flight that killed 329 people on board. 																								One of the witnesses  neither can be identified under a court order  is a woman supposed to have a loving relationship with accused Ripudaman Singh Malik. 																								The other was apparently asked to be a human sacrifice, lawyer Joe Bellows told court yesterday. 																								The woman, who is expected to testify next month, will state that Malik twice confessed to her that he participated in the Air-India bombing, Bellows claimed. In a conversation with her, Malik allegedly admitted he had booked and paid for an airline ticket on the doomed flight. 																								The other witness, Bellows said, will give evidence that Malik had asked him to be a human sacrifice and asked him to take a suitcase with a bomb on an Air-India flight to teach the government of India a lesson. 																								Malik and a second accused, Ajaib Singh Bagri, have been charged with the murder of the 329 people killed in the June 25, 1985, explosion of the Kanishka flight from Toronto to London. 																								They are also on trial for the death of two baggage handlers killed in an explosion at Japans Narita airport 54 minutes earlier.The woman, said Bellows, will tell the court that Malik told her that he booked two tickets for two different flights from Vancouver that were to connect to Air-India flights.																								He allegedly changed the reservations to make better connections and sent someone to pick up the tickets, giving the person cash to cover the cost, the lawyer said.
