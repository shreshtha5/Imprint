                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       POOR JOKE                                                    
	Given the famed absenteeism of Indias parliamentarians  in the house and in their constituencies  it should be hardly surprising that only about a dozen of them were found paying homage to the martyrs of the December 13 terror attack on Parliament. It could be that parliamentarians can no longer trust themselves to keep the solemnity of such occasions. Last year, Ganga Devi, widow of a slain assistant sub-inspector, had broken through the security cordon to remind those present, including the prime minister, that the ceremony had become a meaningless ritual and an occasion for dignitaries to share private jokes among themselves. However, it is unlikely that even such a direct message has reached home. There has neither been a dearth of such occasions nor any significant fall in the attendance of the jovial parliamentarians. Take the December 13 function itself, which has continued to be hosted by the government despite non-cooperation from the families of the victims, even as they have returned gallantry medals because the compensation promised has not reached them and the accused have not been punished.        
	Evidently, Indias politicians are slow learners. In spite of the public venom spewed on them after the Mumbai terror attack, they are yet to realize the gulf that separates them from their electorate. If the vengeful bypassing of politicians in all public gatherings held in remembrance of the dead in the Mumbai terror strikes is indicative of this gulf, so is the alternative ceremony held by the families of the victims of the December 13 attack at the India Gate war memorial. Sadly, like Ganga Devis outburst, this message too might not penetrate the thick hide of the politicians. It was the unsavoury experience of an electoral reverse that ultimately made the Opposition sing the governments tune on terror. This united front too might remain a ritual grandstanding in the end if politicians remain as insensitive as they are suspected to be by the victims of terror to real life concerns of safety and security.
