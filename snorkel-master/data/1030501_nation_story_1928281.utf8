		 Thursday, May 01, 2003 				 Ticket clue in Kanishka trial
																								Vancouver (British Columbia), April 30 (Reuters): The ticket allegedly used to get a bomb on Air-India Flight 182 was purchased using at least one false name, according to evidence presented yesterday in the Kanishka trial.																								Canadian prosecutors used 18-year-old computer records in the first full day of testimony in the trial of Ripudaman Singh Malik and Ajaib Singh Bagri, who are accused of destroying the jetliner, Kanishka, in 1985.																								Malik, 56, a Vancouver businessman, and Bagri, 53, a British Columbia mill worker, have pleaded not guilty to the charges.																								The bomb that destroyed Flight 182 on June 23, 1985, and killed all 329 people on board is believed to have been loaded on a Canadian Pacific aircraft in Vancouver that connected with Air-India flights.
