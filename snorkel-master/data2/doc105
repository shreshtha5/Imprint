Meerut: A 14-year-old boy – grandson of the owner of the horse chariot that was booked for the wedding – died in a celebratory firing done during the wedding procession of one Monu Rathi on Saturday late night in Baghpat’s Baraut. The teenager, Akshay (who went by his first name), had accompanied his grandfather Sukhbeer to the wedding to take care of the horse that was booked by the groom’s family. Amid the dance and music, the groom’s cousin Gautam allegedly fired from his gun in celebration, but it hit the boy, who died on the spot.
