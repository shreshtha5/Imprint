 BASANT RAWAT				 	 Modi: More trouble																								Ahmedabad, Aug. 22: Three top officials who deposed before the Nanavati commission over the last week have contradicted each other about a meeting at chief minister Narendra Modis bungalow on the night of the Godhra train carnage.																								Then director-general of police K. Chakravarthy, Ahmedabad police commissioner P.C. Pande and additional chief secretary (home) Ashok Narayan, however, concurred that Modi had called an emergency meeting at his Gandhinagar residence.																								At this meeting on February 27, 2002, the chief minister is believed to have instructed police either not to act or act with a soft hand.																								Narayan told the commission probing the Godhra train burning that Modi shared the perception that there would be a Hindu backlash because of the incident. Despite this, the chief minister took the decision to bring the bodies of all the 58 who perished in the Godhra train burning to Ahmedabad  though only 26 belonged to the city  and this ignited communal passions, the bureaucrat said during his cross-examination.																								However, the former DGP contradicted Narayan. We only discussed law and order. We did not discuss whether or not the bodies should be brought to Ahmedabad, Chakravarthy told the commission.																								Pande  Narayan could not recall whether he was present at the meeting  could not even remember what they had discussed.																								All three officials claimed they did not know that the Vishwa Hindu Parishad had given a call for a Gujarat bandh that was supported by the ruling BJP.																								Narayan told the panel that they feared unprecedented communal trouble after the Godhra train burning and knew they did not have adequate forces to handle the situation, a perception that he claimed was also shared by Modi. The government had, however, waited until March 1 to seek the armys help in controlling the situation.																								Pande had also apparently not advised the chief minister against bringing the bodies to Ahmedabad. The tension that was building following the bandh called by the VHP flared up only after the bodies were brought to the Ahmedabad Sola Civil Hospital.																								The then in-charge of Naroda police station, K.K. Maisurwala, told the panel that he did not inform the city police control room about the Naroda-Patia massacre as he had instructions not to send any message to the control room through wireless sets. Pande claimed not to have known about the killings because of this.																								However, the issuing of such an instruction suggests that senior police officials had an inkling of what was in store.																								Analysts believe these depositions suggest that the riots could have been prevented had the police tackled the situation with an iron hand.																								Advocate Mukul Sinha, who has been cross-examining witnesses and victims, said the chief minister will have to get ready to be grilled as the truth about the February 27 meeting is yet to come out.
