 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ranchi, Nov. 8: The Centre has decided to allocate seats for state police personnel battling extremists at the CRPFs commando training school and the Grey Hound Commando Training Centre in Hyderabad. 																								This was decided after a marathon meeting of top officials of at least nine extremist-affected states in Ranchi today.																								The meeting mapped an extensive training programme for the police personnel and also chalked out a strategy for sharing intelligence. The regrouping of extremists and their contacts with forces outside the country is a matter of concern. We are working out an intensified strategy to counter them, Union home secretary N. Gopal Swamy told reporters this evening. He was flanked by Jharkhand chief secretary G. Krishnan, home secretary Sushma Singh and director-general of police Rajiv Ranjan Prasad.																								Swamy, who presided over the meeting attended by chief secretaries, home secretaries and the directors-general of police of the extremist-hit states, said emphasis was laid on proper implementation of development schemes in the areas affected by Left-wing extremism.																								Besides Jharkhand, officials from Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and West Bengal were present at the meeting.																								The Centre has also decided to take up the increasing threat from Maoist extremists in Nepal with the government in Kathmandu.																								These are issues which are taken up time to time by India during course of discussions with our Nepalese counterparts. But the influx of Maoists is more from the areas of Nepal bordering Bihar. The Bihar government has taken adequate steps to check infiltration, Swamy said.																								The officers voiced concern over the killings of police personnel in landmine explosions in the Naxalite-hit areas. The matter is of grave concern and we are chalking out a strategy to counter it, Swamy added.																								The Union home secretary announced Central aid of Rs 42 crore for Jharkhand police. While Rs 2 crore has been earmarked for security-related expenditure, the rest will be spent on modernising the force.																								Jharkhand police had failed to use the amount sanctioned in the last fiscal year for modernisation.
