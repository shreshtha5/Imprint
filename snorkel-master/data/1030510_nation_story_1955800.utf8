		 Saturday, May 10, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																SC pay order for Bihar employees				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court on Friday directed the Bihar government to deposit Rs 50 crore with Patna High Court for its disbursal to employees working in several state corporations without pay for over 10 years.				 																																																	The bench directed the high court to utilise the money for disbursal of salaries of 19 corporations.				 																																																	The interim order was given by a bench of Chief Justice V.N. Khare and Justice S.B. Sinha on a public interest litigation filed by Kapila Hingorani, who was the first to file a PIL in the Supreme Court on the Bhagalpur blinding case in the eighties.				 																																																	The petitioner had alleged that non-payment of salaries had driven the employees to a state of penury and several have committed suicide.				 																																																	When the state counsel expressed the governments inability to deposit Rs 50 crore in a month, the court said the government could deposit the money in two months. It should deposit Rs 25 crore in the first month and the balance in the next.				 																																																	The court directed the high court to dispose of liquidation proceedings of all government corporations as soon as possible and pass interim orders for sale and disposal of the properties to utilise the money for payment of salaries.				 																																																	The apex court also asked the high court to constitute a committee of its retired judges or sitting district judges to scrutinise the assets and liabilities of the sick government corporations. The committee should submit a report to the high court within three months, the bench said. All expenses of the committee would be borne by the state, it added.				 																Forensic test for Tehelka tapes New Delhi (PTI): Reversing previous rulings,  the Tehelka commission has ordered detailed forensic examination  of the videotapes containing allegations of corruption in  defence deals, saying it has serious doubts that these  might be tampered or not be the camera originals.				 																																																	As many as 16 videotapes submitted by the newsportal, Tehelka, to the commission will be sent for forensic examination by independent and impartial experts following a 31-page order by Justice S.N. Phukan.				 																																																	Accepting a plea by Samata Party leader Jaya Jaitly and others, the former Supreme Court judge said the commission had prima-facie doubts that the tapes, which were the ultimate arbiters, might be tampered. These doubts have to be removed and the truth with regard to the videotapes has to be found, he said.
