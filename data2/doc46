TITLE:Two killed in firing in Lahore’s sessions court.
CONTENT:At least two people - a police official and an under-trial murder suspect - were killed on Wednesday when an armed man opened fire on them on the premises of the sessions court in Lahore, the capital of Pakistan’s Punjab.

Superintendent of police (city) Ali Raza told PTI that murder suspect Amjad was brought hand-cuffed to the sessions court from the camp jail for hearing when an armed man (later identified as Tauqeer) posing as lawyer (to skip security check) entered the court premises and opened fire on Amjad.

“Amjad died on the spot. When the policemen present there rushed to catch him he opened fire on them leaving two of them injured,” Raza said.

The injured policemen were shifted to a nearby hospital where one of them, Asif, succumbed to his injuries while the condition of the other is stated to be critical.

Raza further said Amjad allegedly had killed the father of Tauqeer in 2015.

“Apparently, Tauqeer shot dead Amjad to avenge the killing of his father,” he said, adding that Taqueer managed to flee from the scene.

“Police teams have been constituted to arrest the suspect. We are also investigating as how the suspect managed to bring a weapon in court,” he said.

Additional sessions judge Imran Shafi who was to hold the hearing of the case has ordered inquiry into the matter.
