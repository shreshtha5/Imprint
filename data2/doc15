TITLE:Indonesia volcano: Mount Sinabung erupts in Sumatra
CONTENT:Thousands of Indonesian villagers evacuated when a volcano erupted for the first time in four centuries returned home on Tuesday, but officials said it was uncertain whether the threat from the volcano had passed. Mount Sinabung, in North Sumatra, erupted for the first time in 400 years on Sunday. A second, more forceful eruption occurred early on Monday, sending plumes of dark grey smoke and volcanic ash up to 2 km (1.5 miles) into the air.
