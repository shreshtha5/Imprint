Mercury dips in Mussoorie after hailstorm.
Dehradun, February 13.
The mercury dropped drastically in the hill station of Mussoorie on Tuesday as a major hailstorm hit the town.
All roads in the town, including the famous Mall Road, were covered by a thick white layer of hail as traffic was disrupted and people preferred to stay indoors in the morning. It has also been raining in many parts of the hill state for the last 24 hours.
Hail and rain accompanied by lightning will continue over the next 24 hours. 
There has also been snowfall in Dhanaulti, Nagtibba, Burashkhanda and Surkunda, neighbouring Mussoorie. 
Due to the high day temperatures, the tourism industry suffered here, but change in the weather could now ring in some business before the winter bids goodbye. â€” IANS
