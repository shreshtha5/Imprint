          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              Mumbai, Nov 27; 01.25 PM (PTI): At least three foreigners were killed and 18 others injured when heavily-armed terrorists attacked two luxury hotels and other places in southern Mumbai overnight.  Besides a British national, the foreigners killed in the attacks were an Australian and a Japanese.  British High Commissioner Sir Richard Stagg said the UK national died in the attack on the Taj hotel, where seven of his compatriots were also injured. He did not identify the victims.  Describing the attack as ldquo;totally unjustified rdquo;, Sir Richard told reporters outside the hotel that an advisory has been issued to UK nationals to avoid visiting Mumbai and other places in Maharashtra.
  A top British security officer will be visiting Delhi on Monday, he said.  The slain Japanese national was identified as Hisa Phuda (41), who was brought dead to the Bombay hospital in south Mumbai late last night, hospital sources said.  An Australian, Braid Gilbert Taylor (49), was also brought dead to St George hospital in south Mumbai, officials said.  Eleven other foreigners of different nationalities were injured in the terror strikes and were admitted to the Bombay hospital.  Hospital sources said the injured foreigners are from Australia, USA, Norway, Spain, Canada and Singapore.
