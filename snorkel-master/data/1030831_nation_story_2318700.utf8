 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI																								New Delhi, Aug. 30: A terrorist strike in the capital was foiled tonight after police shot dead two Jaish-e-Mohammad militants following a tip-off from three persons arrested earlier with a truck laden with arms and ammunition.																								Delhi police also found 21 kg of explosives from the busy New Delhi railway station.																								The militants, including a Pakistani, were killed after a brief exchange of fire around 10.45 pm in Indraprastha Millennium Park under Nizamuddin police station, nearly three hours after the police seized the truck in the Sadar Bazar area in central Delhi. The truck was carrying one rocket launcher, 10 hand grenades and 10 rocket shells.																								The militants  Jahoor Ahmed of Pakistan and Habibullah  were shot when the police tried to intercept them following the lead provided by Pervez Ahmed, Farooq Ahmed and Noor Mohammad, joint commissioner of police (special cell) Neeraj Kumar told reporters at the spot.																								An AK-56 rifle, two magazines with 30 rounds each, two loaded Chinese pistols and Rs 2 lakh in cash were found on the slain terrorists, he added.																								Those arrested with the truck told the police that the consignment was to be delivered to two of their associates at Indraprastha Park, Kumar said. A police team reached the park, where they noticed a white Maruti 800 with two occupants. When intercepted, the occupants tried to run towards the park firing at the cops, he said.																								The police retaliated and, in the encounter, the militants were killed at the entrance of the park on the Outer Ring Road near Nizamuddin bridge, the police officer added.																								Earlier, around 7.30 pm, the police arrested the truck driver and cleaner, both Kashmiris, when they were handing over three fruit boxes containing the arms to Noor Mohammad, Kumar said.																								Noor Mohammad had to deliver the consignment to the two slain terrorists, he said, adding that after the encounter, the slain militants were identified by him.																								The truck, bearing the registration number JK-03-0153, was intercepted on a day the Jaish-e-Mohammads chief commander in India and the mastermind behind the Parliament attack two years ago, Gazi Baba, was killed in Srinagar.																								The police were on the lookout for the truck following a tip-off that terrorists were planning a major strike and arms and ammunition would be arriving in the capital for the purpose.																								Delhi police were virtually on their toes throughout the day, recovering 150 gelatine sticks weighing 21.2 kg at a platform at the busy New Delhi railway station in a bag. Even as the force was on the lookout for the persons behind it, the police nabbed a man at Nizamuddin railway station and recovered Rs 77 lakh.																								Kumar said the police had information that terrorists want to carry out a major strike in the capital and we are on alert. Connaught Place was one of the targets of the terrorists.																								He, however, ruled out any direct link between the recovery of explosives at New Delhi railway station and the events in Sadar Bazar and Indraprastha park.																								He also denied any link between the shootout here and the killing of Gazi Baba.
