TITLE:10 acres of forest destroyed in fire.
CONTENT:Mysuru: Miscreants set fire to a reserve forest area atop Chamundi Hills towards Uttanahalli Main Road on Monday. It took four hours for firefighters to bring the fire under control.

According to the fire and emergency service officers, the fire broke out at around 3.45pm on Chamundi Hills near Uttanahalli Main Road. Due to the dry grass and trees, the fire quickly spread to large area. Nearly 10 acres has been burnt.


A S Shiva Swaroop Urs, an engineer, who was visiting his farm in Adjana noticed the fire and alerted fire personnel. "I noticed the fire from my farm which is about 2 km from Chamundi Hills. A large portion of the hills was on fire and it appeared to be spreading fast and I alerted fire personnel," he said. 

Nearly 45 fire service staff rushed to the spot with six fire tenders and it took nearly four hours to douse the raging fire. District fire officer KP Gururaj told TOI that had the fire watcher at Chamundi Hills been alert, the fire could have been brought under control much earlier.
