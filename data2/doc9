TITLE:12 die in NY apartment blaze.
CONTENT:At least 12 persons, including an infant, were killed after a massive fire broke out at an apartment building in The Bronx, New York City, media reports said.The authorities said the death toll could rise. The fire, that began at 6.51 pm on Thursday, gutted the building near the Bronx Zoo, the New York Post said.

“We’re here at the scene of an unspeakable tragedy in the middle of the holiday season,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said during a press briefing. “Tonight here in The Bronx, there are families that have been torn apart. This is the worst fire tragedy we have seen in this city in at least a quarter century. Four persons critically injured are fighting for their lives.”

A law enforcement official said the infant was found cradled in her mother’s arms in the bathtub. They were both dead. Fire Department New York Commissioner Daniel Nigro said the fire started on the first floor and quickly spread to the five-storey building with 25 apartments. The commissioner said it was too early to determine what caused the fire. —IANS
