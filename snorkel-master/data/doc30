TITLE:40 dead, dozens wounded in multiple blasts in Kabul.
CONTENT:At least 40 people were killed and dozens more wounded in multiple blasts at a Shiite cultural centre in Kabul on Wednesday, officials said, in the latest deadly violence to hit the Afghan capital.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the Taliban was quick to deny involvement in the assault near the Afghan Voice Agency, a media outlet which earlier reports had suggested could have been the target.

Deputy interior ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said the blasts were in fact aimed at the Shiite Tabayan cultural centre.

"A ceremony was being held to mark the 38th anniversary of Soviet invasion in Afghanistan when the explosion went off," he said.

"We have 40 killed, 30 wounded, but this is not the final toll. It might go up," he added.

Rahimi said the main blast was followed by two smaller bomb explosions that did not cause casualties.

Kabul has become one of the deadliest places in war-torn Afghanistan for civilians in recent months, as the Taliban step up their attacks and the Islamic State group (IS) seeks to expand its presence in the country.

Thursday's assault comes days after a suicide bomber killed six civilians in an attack near an Afghan intelligence agency compound in the city, which was claimed by the IS.

A man attending the anniversary ceremony said he heard a "big boom".
